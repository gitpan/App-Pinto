=head1 NAME

App::Pinto::Command::verify - report archives that are missing

=head1 VERSION

version 0.041

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT verify

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command reports distributions that are defined in the repository
database, but the archives are not actually present.  This could occur
when L<Pinto> aborts unexpectedly due to an exception or you terminate
a command prematurely.

At the moment, it isn't clear how to fix this situation.  In a future
release you might be able to replace the archive for the distribution.
But for now, this command simply lets you know if something has gone
wrong in your repository.
